# 📘 Machine Learning: From Theory to Practice  

This repository is a consolidation of my personal learning journey in machine learning, inspired by the *Machine Learning Specialization* by Andrew Ng.

Instead of just applying pre-built libraries, I’ve attempted to connect the theory, math, and intuition with from-scratch implementations and real-world applications, with the goal of reinforcing my own understanding.

The structure reflects this progression:

📐 **Theory & Math** – capturing the key derivations and intuitions

💻 **Implementation** – translating equations into working NumPy code

🌍 **Projects** – applying the concepts to real-world datasets
